Bounty

This is a Full Stack Web Application to track job applications and contacts at the companies to aid in career development.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, TailWindCSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Auth0, and MVC Architecture

Lessons Learned:
I learned about full stack development in a MVC architecture. I hope the usefullness of the app is obvious to all that use it.

Optimizations:
Future planned features include a Group setting for people to share and edit job postings to aid the record keeping process.  This will also include sharing features with email option.
