Bounty

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, TailWindCSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Auth0, and MVC Architecture
Deployment options: Can be deployed directly or with Docker container
Details added to landing page of the architecture and deploy process.

Lessons Learned:
I learned about full stack development in a MVC architecture. I hope the usefullness of the app is obvious to all that use it.
Also, learned how to make docker files and deploy containers.

Optimizations:
Future planned features include a Group setting for people to share and edit job postings to aid the record keeping process.  This will also include sharing features with email option.



Will be deployed via Ansible. Possibly a Kubernetes app.
